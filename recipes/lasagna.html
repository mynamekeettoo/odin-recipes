            <li>Onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>Garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>Tomato paste (optional, for added richness)</li>
            <li>Dried Italian herbs (such as oregano, basil, and thyme)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>Mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley or basil leaves, chopped (for garnish)</li>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to the temperature indicated on the lasagna noodle package instructions.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate large skillet or saucepan, heat some oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, saut√©ing until they become translucent and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef or Italian sausage (or both) to the skillet and cook until browned, breaking it up into small pieces with a spoon or spatula. If using sausage, remove the casings before cooking.</li>
            <li>Pour in the tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes, and tomato paste (if using). Stir well to combine. Season with dried Italian herbs, salt, and pepper to taste. Let the sauce simmer on low heat for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with some salt and pepper to taste. Mix well to ensure the seasoning is evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to the temperature specified on the lasagna noodle package instructions, or as indicated in your recipe.</li>
            <li>Now it's time to assemble the lasagna. Start by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce at the bottom of a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce, ensuring they cover the dish completely without overlapping. Break the noodles if needed to fit the edges of the dish.</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layering process with the remaining ingredients, alternating between noodles, meat sauce, ricotta cheese mixture, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese. Continue until all the ingredients are used, or until you reach the top of the baking dish, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and cheese.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for about 30-35 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Once baked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. This will make it easier to slice and serve.</li>
            <li>Garnish with freshly chopped parsley or basil leaves for added freshness and flavor.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</li>
